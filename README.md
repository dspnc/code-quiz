# code-quiz
This project will make up a webpage with a dynamic coding quiz built with Javascript, including a timer and score tracking using the browser's localStorage.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
The motivation of this project is to utilize javascript to manipulate DOM elements dynamically and learn how to use id's and query selectors to manipulate HTML in the script

- Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to practice query selectors, creating elements and applying changes via javascript, as well as utilizing local storage 

- What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem of generating a dynamic webpage purely using javascript, allowing a user to build a quiz and track results for different players using the browser's local storage

- What did you learn?
I learned how to effectively utilize javascript and css to show/hide different HTML elements in order to render up a dynamic singular web page responsive to different inputs. I also learned that variable-naming is very important so that the javascript is easy to understand. I used the browser dev tools more than ever to troubleshoot bugs via the console errors
